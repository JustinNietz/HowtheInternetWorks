            <p class="topic-push">
                When <strong>Jerry Yang</strong> and <strong>David Filo</strong>’s teacher went on a yearlong
                sabbatical, they started goofing around on
                the web. They were trying to find a way of using the Internet to win a Stanford fantasy basketball
                league. In hunting around for obscure sports data on the Internet, Jerry and David were taking the first
                steps on the road to search.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                They decided to create a simple directory that could show web users how to find stuff online. It was
                just a bunch of categories and sub-categories that you could look around in. Millions of users from
                around the globe flocked to their site, and they soon realized they needed a shorter, snappier name for
                their site; <strong>Yahoo</strong> was born.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                A venture capitalist named <strong>Michael Moritz</strong> decided to pay Yahoo’s young founders a visit
                in their
                Stanford trailer. No one had figured out how to make money off the Internet, but Yahoo would change all
                that. It helped launched the gold rush that would soon engulf the web.

            <h2>Advertising Online</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                At the dawn of the web, no one used it for business or commerce. The arguments around the impending
                commercialization of the web were fierce, and they boiled down to just one word: advertising.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Late in 1995, Yahoo began taking banner ads which proved those arguments didn’t matter as the user base
                kept on multiplying. For the first time, Yahoo had shown it was possible to make money on the web. It
                was a crucial moment and meant one thing: the web boom had begun. In 1996, Yahoo faced an assortment of
                challengers, but their most formidable rival was a company called <strong>Excite</strong>. Rather than a
                list of sites
                complied and sorted into categories by human beings, Excite’s software would crawl the web, find pages
                that contain the term you’d enter.

            <p class="topic-push">
                By 1997, companies like Yahoo and Excite were busy turning themselves into what were known as <strong>Portals</strong>
                -
                one-stop destinations jam-packed with diversions from stock tickers to email to chat room. They were
                designed to turn users into a captive audience for the benefit of advertisers. By focusing on the flash,
                they lost sight of what it was that brought users to them in the first place: the need to find things on
                the expanding web.

            <h2>The Creation of Google</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Google’s founders were <strong>Larry Page</strong> and <strong>Sergey Brin</strong> from Stanford
                University. Larry’s insight started with
                the notion that the number of times a given web page was linked to by other sites might be a measure of
                how useful or how relevant it was. As they put it in a now famous academic paper in 1998, <em>“In
                essence,
                Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote by page A for page B. Google assesses of pages
                importance by the votes it receives.”</em>
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Larry’s insight about link counting was simple but kind of brilliant. It was the core of Google’s
                incredible success. When Google was launched onto the Stanford website, there was so much traffic to
                Google that it nearly brought the entire Stanford University’s internet down. The university
                administration said they must move off the campus.

            <p class="topic-push">
                Vinod Khosla, a venture capitalist invested in Excite, believed that if Excite bought Google, it would
                give them an edge over Yahoo. The CEO of Excite didn’t care, however, as he believed Excite’s search
                engine was good. At the time they did not know Excite turned down one of the most profitable deals in
                history by not acquiring Google. Larry and Sergey sought out a professor from Stanford was also a serial
                entrepreneur, <strong>David Cheriton</strong>. David then called up his friend, <strong>Andy
                Bechtolsheim</strong>, who was a co-founder of
                Sun Microsystems Inc. Andy was so impressed, he wrote them a check for 100,000 dollars on the spot. They
                received checks from other <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"

                Google wanted to organize all the information in the world making it searchable and universally
                accessible. However, they were losing money because they did not put banner ads on their site. They
                simple could not stomach the idea of Google turning into just another portal.

            <h2>Google’s Advertisement Dilemma</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                They wanted to make sure they left people with a great experience but also with advertisements that made
                sense to people. They wanted ads in a more user friendly, webified form. They could not think of what
                that would be.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                In true Silicon Valley style, they found their solution by copying it from Idealab.
                It was Bill Gross who ran Idealab and cracked the riddle of internet advertising. Bill Gross saw before
                anyone else that a search engine could be and probably would be the world’s most powerful and efficient
                market research tool.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Gross realized that <strong>keywords</strong>, which are terms you type into a search engine, could be
                worth a fortune.
                In 1998 he launched a site based on keywords and sponsored links that would eventually be known as
                <strong>Overture</strong>. It became an instant success.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Back in Silicon Valley, Google would see his idea as the solution to its business model quandary. The
                pair arranged to meet with Bill Gross. They talked about ways to blend the great monetization that
                Overture had and the incredibly relevant search results that Google had. Google walked away from the
                talks without cutting any kind of deal and then, shortly after, they released a service called <strong>Adwords</strong>
                that was uncannily similar to Overtures. Google would tweak Gross’ original idea in important ways. It
                would separate the ads from the so-called organic search results.

                With Google personalizing ads, there became a fear of privacy. Terry Winograd, a former professor of Com
                Sci at Stanford had these parting words: “People are going to feel there really is a danger in having
                too much information stored about everything they’ve done, everything they’ve searched for and were
                going to see more and more about that.”
