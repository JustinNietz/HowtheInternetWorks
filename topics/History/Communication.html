                    The Internet had an enormous impact on our daily life, but now it was time for internet users to

            <p class="topic-push">
                These goal of this new businesses was to give power to users to control their digital content
                consumption.
                The greatest pioneer of them was Napster, which opened the door for <em>inventing the idea of</em>

                    <em><strong>digital goods</strong></em>
                </a>
                . Napster was founded in 1999. It provided a software application which is served as a platform for <em>sharing
                digital audio</em> files among users. This meant if you had an album by a musician, you could share it
                with others who are interested in
                getting it. At the same time, you had the opportunity to look at other users’ lists of digital audio
                files and
                download whatever you liked. This whole process was possible thanks to inventing the method of
                compressing audio files without any
                quality damage (

                </a>
                ); it resulted in much smaller file size, so then uploading and downloading a song became much faster.
                It was a revolutionary idea and became immensely popular among young adults.

                There was only one problem; the <em>copyright owners of these songs</em> (producers, studios, and
                musicians) <em>did not get any financial compensation</em> from this file-sharing mechanism.
                Napster got sued (main suers: Dr. Dre and Metallica) because of its illegal activity. The lawsuit
                attracted attention, which resulted in more and more users joined Napster.
                Even so, in 2001 Napster had to <em>shut down due to the verdict</em> of the lawsuit. However, after
                this legal battle new companies emerged to fight for

                Digg.com’s main goal was to <em>eliminate the old method</em> when executives and editors decided
                which news is available for you.
                Digg.com created a system wherein <em>your peers</em> can send in and vote on news articles; this
                resulted in <em>which article is worth publishing</em> on the website.
                Briefly, the users can decide what is important news for them.

            <p class="topic-push">
                YouTube was created in 2005 because its founders thought it is <em>hard to distribute and produce
                your digital content</em> within traditional media.
                They wanted to provide a platform where your content can be easily accessible to users, and you do
                not lose your rights over your product after publishing it.
                Their motto summarizes this efficiently: <em><strong>Broadcast yourself!</strong></em> However,
                YouTube had also legal battles like Napster because users did not upload only user-generated content but
                copyrighted videos too.
                YouTube luckily survived the lawsuits thanks to the resources of Google, which owns YouTube.
                The website fights against uploading copyrighted content, but it is still a problem.

                Myspace – founded in 2003 – was one of the first sites which we can call a social media site.
                Every user could have a <em>profile site, which mimicked the user’s taste</em> in décor (band
                posters, friends’ pictures in the background).
                You had the opportunity to listen to music with the help of a built-in music player during spending
                time on the website.
                It became so popular that <em>musicians and Hollywood studios started to use</em> this site for
                promotion. In a short time, competition arrived; Facebook was founded in 2004.

            <p class="topic-push">
                After the burst of the dot.com bubble, a new era came where <em>the crowd got the power to
                contribute</em> to the human culture.
                The possibilities are vast: anyone can be an amateur journalist as a blogger; you can make your
                advertisement on Craigslist; or you can help to build an enormous digital encyclopedia on Wikipedia.
                Finally, <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, the founder of the World Wide Web, is satisfied
                because the Web took that path
                he wanted in the first place: Let people create and not just consume products. The Internet needs to
                be <em>a two-way road</em>.
