                <i>In the 1990s a <em>new model of commerce</em> emerged, which was based on using the Internet and
                    harnessing the power of individual customers.
                    New businesses were founded like Amazon.com and eBay.com, which operated their retail business fully
                    online.
                    Let us have a look at their operations.</i>

            <p class="topic-push">
                <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> launched <strong>Amazon.com</strong> in 1995. His idea came from that time
                when he was working at a Wall Street firm. He observed the tremendous possibilities in using the
                Internet to sell products.
                He made a list of possible items to sell, and his final decision was: <em>books</em>. He reasoned that
                there were millions of book titles out in the market but there was not such a bookstore that could hold
                all these titles.

            <p class="topic-push">
                <strong>Pierre Omidyar</strong> thought a marketplace on the Web would be fairer and more accessible
                than any other existing market.
                So, he created <strong>eBay.com</strong> during a long weekend all by himself in 1995; he needed to code
                mostly three things for the future users of his <strong>auction site</strong>:
                how to create an item, a possibility for accessing all items others already created, and a feature to
                bid on these items.

            <h2>The Use of the Internet Spreads Rapidly</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Just to put into perspective how fast the Internet spread; to reach 50 million users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="topic-push">Radio needed 38 years</li>
                <li class="topic-push">Television reached this point in 13 years</li>
                <li class="topic-push"><em>The Internet</em> had the same amounts of users <em>only in 4 years</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="topic-push">
                This explosive growth was driven by two facts. Firstly, we need to mention <strong>Moore’s law</strong>
                which says that the power of
                <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"
                   title="An integrated circuit or also referred to as a chip, or a microchip is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece of semiconductor material that is normally silicon.">

                </a>
                doubles every 18 months. Thanks to this fact, computers became smaller and less expensive, in a word,
                more accessible to an average customer.
                Secondly, according to <strong>Metcalf’s law</strong>, every new user does not just add a new connection
                to the network, its effect are much bigger,
                as it has the potential to connect to all the other users in the network. It means that as the number of
                internet users grows,
                the <em>usefulness of the Internet grows</em>, too, at a much higher rate.

            <p class="topic-push">
                Wall Street firms took notice of the immense growth of these new internet-based companies, and <em>capital
                began to pour</em> into these new start-ups.
                The reason they did not fear the risk was that Jeff Bezos’s view started to expand among stockbrokers.
                Jeff Bezos stated that profit can be sacrificed temporarily to reach rapid growth in the market.
                Shortly, this strategy was called: <em><strong>Get big fast!</strong></em> This blind belief in growth
                led to the doubling of Amazon.com’s stock price in just a couple of weeks;
                other web-based companies enjoyed similar benefits in the stock market.

                The easily accessible capital started to attract more and more entrepreneurs; <em>a lot of new start-ups
                popped up</em> without any solid business plan or experience in this industry.
                After a while, stockbrokers and financial analysts noticed that there is <em>no real revenue behind
                these new e-commerce businesses</em>, but they did not stop recommending these stocks (IPOs) to their
                customers because they did not want to risk their incoming earnings.
                Venture capitalists also knew that most of these companies will not thrive, but they were blinded by the
                possibility to find something similar like Amazon.com or eBay.com.
                Finally, the stock market became so overwhelmed that the Federal Reserve Bank needed to raise the

                in early 2000 to stop this bubble grow further.
                Shortly after that, the trust in <em>“Get big fast”</em> dissolved, and <em>the stock market
                collapsed</em>; the NASDAQ lost more than two-thirds of its value.

                companies like Amazon.com and eBay.com, which prioritized customer experience, survived and turned out
                to be hugely profitable worldwide.
                In fact, providing <em>good customer experience</em> became the widespread view among e-commerce
                companies. Furthermore, the billions of dollars of funds were also spent on a good cause during the
