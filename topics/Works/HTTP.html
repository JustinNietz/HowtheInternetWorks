                    The Internet is a design philosophy expressed in a set of protocols. When we talk about a protocol,
                    we think of a <em>well-known set of rules and standards</em> that are used for communication between
                    machines. If
                    all parties agree on using the same protocol, then this agreement will allow them all to communicate
                    without any trouble. Furthermore, this design helps to adopt new technologies in the future.</i>

                How could all computers in the whole world access the Internet and communicate with each other? Let us
                go through the steps. First, we need to <em>choose a</em>
                <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"
                   title="A web browser is a software application for accessing information
                   on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the
                   necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's device.">
                    <em><strong>web browser</strong></em>
                </a>

                and open it.
                Our next task is to <em>type a <strong>web address</strong> or</em>
                <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"
                   title="URL colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its
                   location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.">
                    <em><strong>URL</strong></em></a>

                (Uniform Resource
                Locator) of the website we would like to
                visit. After giving the proper web address, our computer gets in touch with a <strong>server</strong> in
                just a couple of
                milliseconds. Next, <em>your computer gets a response from the server in HTTP</em> (Hyper Text Transfer

                Protocol) language. This
                language is used for communication between web browsers and servers. The conversation between our
                computer and
                the server are <em>mainly <strong>“GET” requests</strong></em>. In this type of request, we are asking
                simply for a <em>specific document written in HTML</em> (Hyper Text Markup Language). The text on a
                website is already included in
                the HTML, however, other elements like <em>images or videos are separate files</em> with their unique
                URLs.
                Each element needs a “GET” request to appear properly on the webpage. If there are too many “GET”
                requests at
                once, we experience <em>a website that loads extremely slowly</em>.

                    an
                    example. We would
                    like to log into our Spotify account to listen to some music. To do that, we need to give our email
                    address and password. This means that our computer or smartphone needs to send <em>a “POST” request

                    the
                    given information</em> to Spotify’s server. If we sent the correct data for login, the server would

                    us
                    into our Spotify account successfully. But <em>during the response, our computer gets a cookie</em>
                    which will
                    help us log in the next time without this whole process. This cookie acts as an ID card that will
                    identity us immediately the next time we login.

                The Internet is a public space. However, we frequently <em>use it for sharing private data</em> like
                credit
                card information or passwords to our accounts on a daily basis. How do we keep them secret? The
                solution to this is <strong>encryption</strong>. Using encryption, we <em>scramble or change our
                original message</em>. After
                hiding our data from prying eyes, the receiver of our message <em>needs to <strong>decrypt</strong>
