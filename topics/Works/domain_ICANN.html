            <h2>Telephones and Packets</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                The telephone system became another catalyst for the creation of the Internet. If the connection path
                between a telephone call is broken, the connection is cut off. This weakness became a matter of national
                security in the early 1960s as they feared a Soviet attack which would cripple their communications in
                effective retaliation. <strong>Dr. Paul Baran</strong>, who was hired to fix this problem, helped to
                create <strong>Hot Potato Routing</strong>, which meant a message transiting a network got to where it
                was going even if part of the network was destroyed.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                This routing led to

                </a>
                Packet Switching. The network chops up a document into a lot of pieces (packets).
                Each packet was like a postcard with a to and from address that would get launched into the network and
                operate independently. The final destination takes all these packets and puts them back into a long
                document at the end. This design for a network, a Packet Switching Network, gets its message through
                better than telephones <em>as long as some part of the network</em> functions.

            <h2>Bob Taylor’s Frustrations</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                The first computer networks stem from the frustrations of a single ARPA scientist, Bob Taylor, who
                needed a separate terminal to log into each of several <strong>time-shared</strong> computers at
                research centers across the country. He knew a single terminal would suffice if all the computers were
                in a common <strong>network</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Taylor was given a million dollars to work on this problem where he recruited Larry Roberts, who built
                the world’s first experimental connection between two computers. Roberts was inspired by a fellow
                engineer, who suggested building identical special-purpose mini computers, called <strong>Interface
                Messaging Processors</strong> (
                <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"

                ), to form the network and tie each computer to one of them.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                He sought out the engineers to build the Advance Research Projects Agency’s computer network, the
                <strong>ARPANET</strong>. The plan was to network 4 identical IMPs. Each one would be attached to a
                different kind of mainframe computer at three different universities across California and one
                in Utah.</p>

                A small Cambridge Massachusetts company known as <strong>BBN</strong> won the contract and went to work
                building the IMPs
                for the ARPANET on January 1st, 1969. Both BBN and UCLA were under a tight deadline. Writing the code to
                have the computers communicate with the IMPs were left to the graduate students or staff members. There
                was concern with the phone lines, which were built for voice traffic and not data or running the
                mainframe computers nonstop. By the end of 1969, all four sites were interconnected and had worked the
                way it was intended.

                In April 1971, the ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network. At first there was not
                much to do beyond transferring data files among its members. Then, a new capability was added that
                would take the usefulness of computer networking to a new level. Raymond Tomlinson created this killer
                application called email. Tomlinson gave the world the @ sign.

                Internet begun in 1969 as an experimental computer network. Anyone could contribute ideas about its use
                and how to improve it. Ideas were offered as requests for comments so everyone would free feel to
                discuss and criticize them. By 1972 the ARPANET had fewer than 25 sites online, yet more were coming.
                What sparked the increase was the first international conference on computers and communication
                sponsored by ARPA.

            <h2>Networks</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Soon other networks emerged. <strong>LAN</strong> (local area networks) linked computers throughout
                offices; <strong>WAN</strong> (wide
                area networks) linked computers across buildings or campuses. Each new network was like a foreign
                country speaking its own language and independent of one another. They needed a common protocol for them
                to communicate.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                In 1973, <strong>Ben Cerf</strong> and <strong>Bob Kahn</strong> teamed up to develop a set of rules or
                procedures known as the

                and if followed by different computer networks, would allow them to pass their message packets
                back and forth. The <strong>Gateway</strong>, as Cerf and Kahn named it, knew how to talk to each of the
                networks it was
                connected to. In 1983 TCP/IP was adopted as a standard.

                Under 1980s technology it was difficult to research a topic. Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN
                Research Institute in Switzerland developed the software to follow threads of knowledge more easily
                within the information stored throughout the internet. By using a computer mouse to click on a word or
                phrase linked across the Internet, one could instantaneously follow a link from site to site around the
                web in pursuit of a topic. The crisscrossing of these threads across the globe reminded him of a web so
                he named his invention the World Wide Web.

                On June 9, 1992, Congress passed a bill taking the Internet out of the exclusive hands of government and
                into the public. The Internet had crossed the Rubicon.
