            <h2>The Foundations</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong> as a kid was always really interested in trains; he built some
                electronic gadgets to
                control his model railway, but after a while he had a revelation that he liked more electronics than his
                train cars. So, he went to Oxford University, then <em>he became a software engineer at
                <strong>CERN</strong></em> - large
                particle physics laboratory near Geneva -. During his work at CERN, he noticed that there was a <em>problem
                with sharing information</em> among colleagues.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                What was his solution? Berners-Lee realized that <em>using the Internet and the newly emerging
                technology
                called <strong>Hypertext</strong></em>, he could make the knowledge exchange among coworkers or just any
                researchers much
                faster and reliable. By October of 1990, Berners-Lee had written three technologies with fundamentally
                importance that became the foundation of the Web we know today.

                Soon after this, the first webpage appeared on the Web, then <em>CERN invited other creators</em>
                outside of the
                organization to join their new community on the Internet. It was a very impactful moment when CERN
                announced in 1993 that the <em>World Wide Web technology would be available for anyone</em> to use on a
                royalty-free basis. This announcement sparked creativity, collaboration, and innovation world-wide.

                LIn 1994 Berners-Lee left CERN and went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) where he found
                the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). His goal was to help the Web reach its full potential; to achieve
                this, the underlying technologies must become global standards, implemented in the same way across the
                world. So, the international community of W3C became devoted to developing open standards. They produced
                some revolutionary ideas which work as guidelines today:

                    connect with that or a greater quality of service, then <em>both parties will communicate at the

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                HTML is <em>the authoring language used for creating documents on the Web</em>. We use it to give
                instructions to
                our web browser <em>how to display the website</em> we asked for. These instructions determine for
                example how
                the headings and text should look, which image should load, or what other special functions are
                available. HTML can do this <em>by using the so-called <strong>tags</strong></em> that have <strong>attributes</strong>.
                For example,&lt;p&gt; means a paragraph break. As we look at the web page, we do not see the HTML; it is
                hidden from our view; we are able to see only the results.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                HTML has evolved a lot throughout the years. With every update, making websites became much easier,
                efficient, and websites looked always nicer. Let us have a look at the different steps a bit.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
            <ul>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 1.0:</strong> It was released in 1993 with the intention of
                    sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. The language was limited;
                    it <em>had support for basic elements like text controls and images</em>.
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 2.0:</strong> It was published in 1995; it contained all the
                    features of HTML 1.0 along with few additional features. W3C was already created at this time, so
                    <em>standardization efforts started with this version</em>.
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 3.2:</strong> It was developed in 1997. This version added widely
                    deployed features such as tables, text flow around images, superscripts, and subscripts. Another
                    important feature what HTML 3.2 implemented was <em>support for <strong>CSS</strong></em> (Cascading
                    Style Sheets).
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 4.01:</strong> This version came out in 1999; It extended the
                    support of cascading styling sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page itself, but in
                    the new version the <em>concept of external styling sheet emerged</em>. Under this concept, an
                    external CSS
                    file could be developed, and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself.
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 5</strong> This is the latest version of HTML; it became accessible
                    for developers in 2014. It came up with lots of HTML tags support: email, password, audio tag,
                    semantic tags (&lt;header&gt;,&lt;nav&gt;,&lt;footer&gt;), and section tag.

                The telephone system became another catalyst for the creation of the Internet. If the connection path
                between a telephone call is broken, the connection is cut off. This weakness became a matter of national
                security in the early 1960s as they feared a Soviet attack which would cripple their communications in
                effective retaliation. <strong>Dr. Paul Baran</strong>, who was hired to fix this problem, helped to
                create <strong>Hot Potato Routing</strong>, which meant a message transiting a network got to where it
                was going even if part of the network was destroyed.

                Packet Switching. The network chops up a document into a lot of pieces (packets).
                Each packet was like a postcard with a to and from address that would get launched into the network and
                operate independently. The final destination takes all these packets and puts them back into a long
                document at the end. This design for a network, a Packet Switching Network, gets its message through
                better than telephones <em>as long as some part of the network</em> functions.

                The first computer networks stem from the frustrations of a single ARPA scientist, Bob Taylor, who
                needed a separate terminal to log into each of several <strong>time-shared</strong> computers at
                research centers across the country. He knew a single terminal would suffice if all the computers were
                in a common <strong>network</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Taylor was given a million dollars to work on this problem where he recruited Larry Roberts, who built
                the world’s first experimental connection between two computers. Roberts was inspired by a fellow
                engineer, who suggested building identical special-purpose mini computers, called <strong>Interface
                Messaging Processors</strong> (

                He sought out the engineers to build the Advance Research Projects Agency’s computer network, the
                <strong>ARPANET</strong>. The plan was to network 4 identical IMPs. Each one would be attached to a

                was concern with the phone lines, which were built for voice traffic and not data or running the
                mainframe computers nonstop. By the end of 1969, all four sites were interconnected and had worked the
                way it was intended.

                In April 1971, the ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network. At first there was not
                much to do beyond transferring data files among its members. Then, a new capability was added that
                would take the usefulness of computer networking to a new level. Raymond Tomlinson created this killer
                application called email. Tomlinson gave the world the @ sign.

                Internet begun in 1969 as an experimental computer network. Anyone could contribute ideas about its use
                and how to improve it. Ideas were offered as requests for comments so everyone would free feel to
                discuss and criticize them. By 1972 the ARPANET had fewer than 25 sites online, yet more were coming.
                What sparked the increase was the first international conference on computers and communication
                sponsored by ARPA.

            <p class="topic-push">
                Soon other networks emerged. <strong>LAN</strong> (local area networks) linked computers throughout
                offices; <strong>WAN</strong> (wide
                area networks) linked computers across buildings or campuses. Each new network was like a foreign
                country speaking its own language and independent of one another. They needed a common protocol for them
                to communicate.

                In 1973, <strong>Ben Cerf</strong> and <strong>Bob Kahn</strong> teamed up to develop a set of rules or
                procedures known as the

                </a>
                and if followed by different computer networks, would allow them to pass their message packets
                back and forth. The <strong>Gateway</strong>, as Cerf and Kahn named it, knew how to talk to each of the
                networks it was
                connected to. In 1983 TCP/IP was adopted as a standard.

                Under 1980s technology it was difficult to research a topic. Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN
                Research Institute in Switzerland developed the software to follow threads of knowledge more easily
                within the information stored throughout the internet. By using a computer mouse to click on a word or
                phrase linked across the Internet, one could instantaneously follow a link from site to site around the
                web in pursuit of a topic. The crisscrossing of these threads across the globe reminded him of a web so
                he named his invention the World Wide Web.

                On June 9, 1992, Congress passed a bill taking the Internet out of the exclusive hands of government and
                into the public. The Internet had crossed the Rubicon.
