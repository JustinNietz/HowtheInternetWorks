            <h2>The Foundations</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong> as a kid was always really interested in trains; he built some
                electronic gadgets to
                control his model railway, but after a while he had a revelation that he liked more electronics than his
                train cars. So, he went to Oxford University, then <em>he became a software engineer at
                <strong>CERN</strong></em> - large
                particle physics laboratory near Geneva -. During his work at CERN, he noticed that there was a <em>problem
                with sharing information</em> among colleagues.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                What was his solution? Berners-Lee realized that <em>using the Internet and the newly emerging
                technology
                called <strong>Hypertext</strong></em>, he could make the knowledge exchange among coworkers or just any
                researchers much
                faster and reliable. By October of 1990, Berners-Lee had written three technologies with fundamentally
                importance that became the foundation of the Web we know today.

                announced in 1993 that the <em>World Wide Web technology would be available for anyone</em> to use on a
                royalty-free basis. This announcement sparked creativity, collaboration, and innovation world-wide.

                LIn 1994 Berners-Lee left CERN and went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) where he found
                the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). His goal was to help the Web reach its full potential; to achieve
                this, the underlying technologies must become global standards, implemented in the same way across the
                world. So, the international community of W3C became devoted to developing open standards. They produced
                some revolutionary ideas which work as guidelines today:

                    connect with that or a greater quality of service, then <em>both parties will communicate at the

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                HTML is <em>the authoring language used for creating documents on the Web</em>. We use it to give
                instructions to
                our web browser <em>how to display the website</em> we asked for. These instructions determine for
                example how
                the headings and text should look, which image should load, or what other special functions are
                available. HTML can do this <em>by using the so-called <strong>tags</strong></em> that have <strong>attributes</strong>.
                For example,&lt;p&gt; means a paragraph break. As we look at the web page, we do not see the HTML; it is
                hidden from our view; we are able to see only the results.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                HTML has evolved a lot throughout the years. With every update, making websites became much easier,
                efficient, and websites looked always nicer. Let us have a look at the different steps a bit.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
            <ul>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 1.0:</strong> It was released in 1993 with the intention of
                    sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. The language was limited;
                    it <em>had support for basic elements like text controls and images</em>.
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 2.0:</strong> It was published in 1995; it contained all the
                    features of HTML 1.0 along with few additional features. W3C was already created at this time, so
                    <em>standardization efforts started with this version</em>.
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 3.2:</strong> It was developed in 1997. This version added widely
                    deployed features such as tables, text flow around images, superscripts, and subscripts. Another
                    important feature what HTML 3.2 implemented was <em>support for <strong>CSS</strong></em> (Cascading
                    Style Sheets).
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 4.01:</strong> This version came out in 1999; It extended the
                    support of cascading styling sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page itself, but in
                    the new version the <em>concept of external styling sheet emerged</em>. Under this concept, an
                    external CSS
                    file could be developed, and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself.
                </li>
                <li class="topic-push"><strong>HTML 5</strong> This is the latest version of HTML; it became accessible
                    for developers in 2014. It came up with lots of HTML tags support: email, password, audio tag,
                    semantic tags (&lt;header&gt;,&lt;nav&gt;,&lt;footer&gt;), and section tag.

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Most of us think that HTML and CSS were created simultaneously. But for years after Berners-Lee invented
                the World Wide Web, there was no such thing as CSS.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Because the <em>layout was not a priority for Berners-Lee</em>, others started to think about how to
                render
                elements on a website. A few thinkers emerged: <strong>Pei-Yuan Wei</strong>, <strong>Marc
                Andreessen</strong> and <strong>Håkon Wium Lie</strong>.
                Pei-Yuan Wei created a graphical ViolaWWW Browser in which <em>he incorporated his stylesheet
                language</em>. It
                did not work properly, but it inspired others. In the meantime, Andreessen had taken a different
                approach in his browser, Netscape Navigator. He did not make a separate language devoted to styling a
                website; <em>he simply just extended HTML to include more presentational HTML tags</em> that could be
                used to
                design web pages.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Finally, Håkon Wium Lie – a Norwegian web pioneer who worked at CERN with Berners-Lee – came out with
                the idea of CSS, and it grabbed everyone’s attention immediately. His goal was that using CSS helps
                <em>people create a uniform look across several pages</em> of a web site. CSS was simple compared to its
                predecessors. It is a <em>declarative programming language</em>. This means we <em>describe our
                rules</em> for the HTML
                document, and after that, we <em>let the browser handle the rendering</em> according to the given rules.
                At that
                time, web pages were built by amateurs and hobbyists, so giving CSS a predictable, forgiving format made
                people acquire this new language much faster.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                CSS is special language because it allows for styles to <strong>cascade</strong>. The cascade feature
                means <em>that styles
                can inherit and overwrite other styles</em> that had previously been declared, following a somewhat
                complicated hierarchy. The biggest breakthrough of all, however, is that it is possible to use multiple
                stylesheets on the same page.
            </p>

            <p class="topic-push">
                Here is an example how to insert CSS into HTML directly. Here we gave the background a color and styled
                the heading too.
