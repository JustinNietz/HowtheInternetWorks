            <h2>What is an IP Address?</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                An <strong class="definition">IP Address</strong> is a single computer’s address on the internet. This
                address is just a number, similar to a
                phone number, that is unique to each computer or device at the edge of the network. It forms part of one
                of the most important protocols used in internet communication called the <strong>internet
                protocol</strong> (IP).
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                An IP address is a bunch of numbers organized in a hierarchy. Each of the numbers are represented in
                bits. IP Addresses are 32 bits long with 8 bits for each part of the address. This version, called IPv4,
                provides more than 4 billion unique addresses for devices connected to the internet.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Four billion, however, won’t be enough in the near future! We are currently in a multi-year transition
                to a longer IP address format called IPv6 which uses 128 bits per address, provides <strong>340</strong>
                <em>undecillion</em>
                unique addresses.

            <h2>What is a Packet?</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                If you have a very large image that you want to send over the internet, that image is made up of tens of
                millions of bits or ones and zeroes, too many to send in one packet. The computer sending the image can
                quickly break it up into hundreds or thousands of smaller parts called packets.</p>

            <p class="topic-push">A <strong class="definition">Packet</strong> – made up of binary – is a sequence of
                ones
                and zeroes sent physically through wired and wireless
                networks. Packets do not
                choose their routes through the distributed network. Each packet only has the internet address of where
                it came from and where it's going.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Router?</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Special computers on the internet called <strong class="definition">Routers</strong> act like traffic
                managers to keep packets moving
                smoothly. If one route is congested, individual packets may travel different routes through the
                internet,
                and they arrived at the destination at slightly different times or even out of order.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                As part of the internet protocol, every router keeps track of multiple paths for sending packets. It
                chooses the cheapest available path for each piece of data based on destination IP address for the
                packet. Cheapest refers to time and non-technical factors such as politics and relationships between
                companies.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Often the best route for data to travel is not the most direct. Having options for paths makes the
                network fault tolerant, which means the networks can keep sending packets even if something goes
                horribly wrong.

            <p class="topic-push">
                The key principle of the internet is reliability. The internet is ultimately a set of protocols. A
                <strong>Protocol</strong> is a well-known set of rules
                and standards used
                to communicate between machines.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                The transmission control protocol (TCP) manages the sending and receiving of all your data as packets.
                Think of it like a guaranteed mail service. For example, when you request a song on your device from
                Spotify, it sends the
                song broken up into many packets. When your packets arrive, TCP does a full inventory and sends back
                acknowledgements of each packet received. If all packets are there, TCP signs for delivery and you are
                done. If it finds some packets are missing, it will not sign the acknowledgement. For each missing or
                incomplete packet, Spotify
                will resend them.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                The TCP and Router systems is they are scalable. They can work with 8 devices or 8
                billion devices. Because of these principles of fault tolerant and redundancy, the more routers we add
                the more reliable the internet becomes.
