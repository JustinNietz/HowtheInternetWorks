                At the University of Illinois Computer Science, a student named <strong>Mark Andreessen</strong> had an
                idea. He said
                that “The internet was only really for academics, researchers and scientists, and there wasn’t anything
                that ordinary people could do with it. But it was so useful to the people who were using it that I

                fall of 1993 they posted it, called <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"

                contacted Andreessen. He was considering starting a new software company and wanted Andreessen on board.
                They plotted how to turn Mosaic into the basis of a business venture. They named their company Netscape
                and even hired undergraduate students from the University of Illinois, where Andreessen was a student.

            <h2>The Microsoft Giant</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                <strong>Bill Gates</strong> created the most important and profitable company of them all. In two
                decades, Microsoft had
                established a near monopoly over <strong>PC operating systems</strong>, and it used that monopoly to
                gain a vice-like
                grip over the entire computer industry. His online system was called the <strong>Microsoft
                Network</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Bill Gates’ story began in 1975 when at the age of 19 he dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft with
                his friend Paul Allen. Gates’ vision was simple and ambitious: a PC on every desktop in every home and
                every office, and all running Microsoft software. By 1993 his dream was close to becoming a reality.
                About <strong>90%</strong> of the world’s PCs were running Microsoft Windows. They played very rough
                with their
                competitors who created their own operating systems. They defeated companies such as Lotus, WordPerfect,
                and even IBM were defeated.

            <h2>Netscape vs. Microsoft</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Netscape culturally already perceived Microsoft as the company to take out when all other companies at
                the time were afraid to face them. On October 13, 1994 after months of coding, Netscape’s new browser,
                <strong>Navigator</strong>, was released, and it was an instant success.

                With the release of Navigator, however, many in Silicon Valley began to imagine a different future where
                the browser could be an alternative platform.

            <p class="topic-push">
                The problem for Netscape was that Bill Gates now perceived the company to be the primary threat to their
                continued dominance.

            <p class="topic-push">
                Gates dispatched a special group of envoys to Netscape’s headquarters. Each side had a separate take on
                the meeting:

            <ul>
                <li class="topic-push">
                    <strong>Microsoft version:</strong> Had this free roaming discussion with them about how we would
                    work with Netscape,
                    how would we work with them on web servers and browsers.

                <li class="topic-push">
                    <strong>Netscape version:</strong> Microsoft offered a deal to Netscape they couldn’t refuse; one
                    million dollars
                    were offered for unlimited access to all their technology. If they didn’t take it, Microsoft was
                    just going to copy everything they did.

            <h2>Microsoft's Revenge</h2>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Microsoft planned to drive Netscape to an early grave with a web browser of its own:  <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"
                   title="Microsoft’s take on the web browser that took elements of Netscape’s browser, but made it free."><strong>Internet Explorer</strong>
                </a>.
                Microsoft had advantages in building their browser, including vast finances and reserves of coding
                talent. Gates also used his army of salesman to stop PC manufacturers from installing anything other
                than Internet explorer by using dirty methods.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Netscape had to charge money for its browser, but Microsoft was able to give Internet Explorer away for
                free. They were able to bundle it into the Windows OS. When Internet Explorer 4 (IE4), came out, the
                Browser War was over. By September 1997, Microsoft had won. From that point on, it was all downhill for
                Netscape. A year later, the company was acquired by a bigger company called <strong>America Online
                (AOL)</strong>.

            <p class="topic-push">
                In 1998, Rebeck launched an  <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right"
                   title="This is the software which other programs run on top."><strong>Antitrust lawsuit</strong>
                </a> against Microsoft on behalf of his clients, which included
                Netscape. He accused them of using their monopoly to engage in a wide variety of predatory practices to
                prevent consumers from accessing Netscape’s products.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                In court, Gates lied about multiple topics, one of which included the meeting with Netscape. He stated
                he had no knowledge of that meeting but then evidence came out of an email he sent his high-level staff
                members about it. The federal judge over the case issued his verdict: guilty and recommended the company
                be broken up causing its stock market value to drop by <em>thirty billion dollars overnight</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="topic-push">
                Eventually, a federal appeals court, though it agreed with the judgement that Microsoft broke the law,
                decided the verdict was too harsh and rescinded the order to split the company.
